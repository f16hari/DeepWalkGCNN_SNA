# DeepWalk and GCNN: Leveraging Network Representation for Fake News Classification in Social Networks
Detecting and combating fake news has become a critical challenge in today's era of social media and online information sharing. In this study, we propose a novel approach that combines DeepWalk, a network representation learning algorithm, with GCNN, a Graph Convolutional Neural Network, to classify fake news in social networks. Our approach leverages the inherent structural properties of social networks to capture the relationships and context surrounding news articles. First, we apply DeepWalk to learn low-dimensional node embeddings by representing the social network as a graph and performing random walks. These embeddings capture the structural similarities and neighborhood information of the nodes, including news articles, users, and their connections. Next, we construct a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) architecture that takes advantage of both the node embeddings and the network structure. The GCNN learns to aggregate information from neighboring nodes to make predictions about the authenticity of news articles. By incorporating both the content and the network context, our model aims to capture both local and global patterns in the spread of fake news. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on a real-world social network dataset containing labeled instances of fake and genuine news articles. We compare our proposed DeepWalk-GCNN model with baseline methods, including traditional machine learning algorithms and other graph-based approaches. Our experimental results demonstrate that the combination of DeepWalk and GCNN outperforms the baselines, achieving higher accuracy and improved detection of fake news. The DeepWalk embeddings capture important structural features of the social network, while the GCNN effectively utilizes this information to make accurate predictions. Additionally, our model exhibits robustness to noise and performs well even in the presence of limited labeled training data. Overall, our study contributes to the field of fake news detection by highlighting the potential of integrating network representation learning with graph convolutional neural networks. The proposed approach offers a promising solution for identifying and combating the spread of fake news in social networks, ultimately fostering a more reliable and trustworthy information ecosystem.
